## Creating the Rojo Project

Rojo has a built-in command to initialize a new game project.

<Tabs groupId="installation-kind">
<TabItem value="vscode" label="VS Code" default>

TODO: VS Code instructions

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

First, open up a terminal window, like `cmd.exe` on Windows or `Terminal.app` on macOS. Navigate to where you'd like to store your new project and run

```sh
rojo init my-new-game
```

Rojo will create a folder named `my-new-game` if it doesn't already exist and create everything you need to get started.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Building Your Place

Now that we have a project, one thing we can do is build a Roblox place file for our project. This is a great way to get started with a project quickly with no fuss.

<Tabs groupId="installation-kind">
<TabItem value="vscode" label="VS Code" default>

TODO: VS Code instructions

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

All we have to do is run `rojo build` from inside the project's folder:

```sh
rojo build -o MyNewGame.rbxlx
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you open `MyNewGame.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio now, you should see a baseplate, as well as code in services like `ReplicatedStorage`.

:::info
To generate a binary place file instead, use `MyNewGame.rbxl`. Note that support for binary model/place files (`rbxm` and `rbxl`) is currently very limited in Rojo v6.
:::

## Live-Syncing into Studio

Building a place file is great for starting to work on a game, but for active iteration, you'll want something faster.

In Roblox Studio, make sure the Rojo plugin is installed. If you need it, check out [the installation guide](installation.mdx) to learn how to install it.

To expose your project to the plugin, you'll need to start a new **live sync session**.

<Tabs groupId="installation-kind">
<TabItem value="vscode" label="VS Code" default>

TODO: VS Code instructions

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```sh
rojo serve
```

You should see output like this in your terminal:

```sh
$ rojo serve
Rojo server listening:
  Address: localhost
  Port:    34872

Visit http://localhost:34872/ in your browser for more information
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Switch into Roblox Studio and press the **Rojo** plugin toolbar button. A dialog should appear:

![Rojo plugin connection dialog](/img/v0.5/connection-dialog.png)

If the port number doesn't match the output from the command line, change it, and then press **Connect**.

If all went well, you should now be able to change files in your project directory and watch them sync into Roblox Studio in real time!

You can also visit the URL printed by Rojo to access extra information about the running session.

## Uploading Your Place

Aimed at teams that want serious levels of automation, Rojo can upload places to Roblox.com automatically.

You'll need an existing game on Roblox.com as well as the `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie of an account that has write access to that game.

:::warning
It's recommended that you set up a Roblox account dedicated to deploying your game instead of your personal account in case your security cookie is compromised.
:::

Generating and publishing your game is as simple as:

<Tabs groupId="installation-kind">
<TabItem value="vscode" label="VS Code" default>

TODO: VS Code instructions

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```sh
rojo upload --asset_id [PLACE ID] --cookie "[SECURITY COOKIE]"
```

If you are on Windows and have Roblox Studio installed, `--cookie` is optional and will be pulled from your Roblox Studio session if not specified.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

An example project is available on GitHub that deploys to Roblox.com via GitHub Actions automatically: [Desert Bus 2077](https://github.com/Roblox/desert-bus-2077)
