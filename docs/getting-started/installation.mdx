# Installation

There are two supported ways to install Rojo:

<Tabs groupId="installation-kind">
<TabItem value="vscode" label="VS Code" default>

If you use Visual Studio Code, you can install [the Rojo VS Code extension][extension], which allows for both halves of Rojo to work within Visual Studio Code, with a nifty UI to sync files and start/stop the Rojo server!

:::info
The VS Code extension does not add `rojo` to your system PATH. In order to use Rojo from the terminal, you'll need to install the CLI separately.
:::

[extension]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evaera.vscode-rojo

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

Rojo has two pieces that need to be installed:

- The Server
- The Roblox Studio plugin

## Installing the Server

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="aftman" label="With Aftman" default>

[Aftman] is a toolchain manager that is useful for managing tools like Rojo for Roblox projects. To install it, follow these [instructions][aftman-installation-instructions].

To install the latest release of Rojo, run the following commands:

```bash
aftman add rojo-rbx/rojo
aftman install
```

[Aftman]: https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman
[aftman-installation-instructions]: https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman#installation

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="github" label="From GitHub">

There are pre-built binaries available for Windows, macOS, and Linux from Rojo's [GitHub Releases page][rojo-releases].

The Rojo CLI must be run from the command line, like `cmd.exe` on Windows or `Terminal.app` on macOS. It's recommended that you put the Rojo CLI executable on your system `PATH` to make this easier.


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="crates" label="From crates.io">

It's also possible to install Rojo releases using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). This will compile Rojo from source and install it on your machine.

To install Rojo 7, use:

```sh
cargo install rojo --version ^7
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Installing the Plugin

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Using the CLI">

Once you've installed the Rojo server, you can use it to install or upgrade the Rojo plugin from the command line.

```bash
rojo plugin install
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="github" label="From GitHub">

The Rojo plugin is available from Rojo's GitHub Releases page.

:::info
Rojo has a separate plugin for each major version. Make sure you install the correct one!
:::

Download the attached `rbxm` file and put it into your Roblox Studio plugins folder. You can find that folder by pressing **Plugins Folder** from your Plugins toolbar in Roblox Studio:

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="roblox" label="From Roblox.com">

The Rojo plugin can be installed from Roblox.com.

Press the 'Install' button on the plugin page to add it to Roblox Studio.
