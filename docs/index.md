Welcome! Rojo is a project management tool designed to get professional resources in the hands of Roblox developers. Here, we'll teach you how to get started with Rojo.

## Why Rojo?

Rojo gives developers access to an industry-standard toolset by syncing externally-edited project files with Roblox Studio.  But what does "industry standard" mean for Roblox developers?

In software-engineering -- whether you're creating a game, or designing a website -- you're generally going to use similar tools for common problems. Both fields need version control, so both might be interested in version control software like Git. A robust set of tools can make up for features that are missing or lacking in Roblox Studio.

Some issues specific to Roblox can be avoided by hosting project files externally, too. In a Studio environment, you'll have to put up with many momentary distractions like auto-saves, crashes, Studio updates, and long loading times for larger projects. Being a cloud-based platform as well, it's impossible to know when a service hiccup will prevent you from working altogether. With Rojo, having offline access to your project through external editors is a boon to your overall productivity.

If you want to leverage professional-grade tools in your Roblox development workflow, here's where to start.

### External Text Editors

With the backing of engineers around the world, Rojo opens the door to some of the best text editors available and their rich plugin ecosystem.

### Version Control

Version control is an essential component of software development. Tracking changes through each iteration of your project prevents you or your team from conducting exhaustive audits as development progresses.

By building your game in a file structure, using version control becomes easy. Programs like Git or GitHub will allow you to organize your project and leverage collaborative tools such as remote exchanges, issue trackers, project synchronization, and more.

### TypeScript

For those familiar with JavaScript, compiling TypeScript through [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.github.io) allows you to take advantage of features like arrow functions, object destructuring, or functional programming methods. More importantly, TypeScript offers a subset of features suited for large projects. With static type safety, developers can track changes made to individual types, mitigate errors, and type faster with unparalled autocomplete.


### Other Tools

Plenty of other tools are available through Rojo.

Popular tools include:

* [Selene](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene), a static analysis tool to help you write better Lua
* [luacheck](https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck), another static analyzer, popular outside the Roblox community
* [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), an extremely fast code search tool
* [Tokei](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei), a tool for statistics like lines of code
* [Roact](https://github.com/Roblox/roact), A declarative UI library for Roblox Lua inspired by React
* [Rodux](https://github.com/Roblox/rodux), A state management library for Roblox Lua inspired by Redux
